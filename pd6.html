        <p>Hi! My name is Winnie Wu. I am a sophomore in Staten Island High School. I am 15 and my birthday is on 7/22. I live in Staten Island. I like spending time with friends and family and value time spent with them. I really like badminton and playing it with friemds. Additionally, I also like going out shopping, especially to malls with my friends. I'm not really that social, but sometimes I would socialize with new people and make new friends.</p>
